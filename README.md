This project is extending the django-forum app by adding an Angular app to display polls

In this lesson I learned:

- How to include AngularJS into Django templates and avoid collisions in templating languages

- How to pass information from Django to AngularJS at the templating stage

- How to communicate over the network with AngularJS services

- How to use an AngularJS Factory
